	abstract = {Accurately simulating fluid dynamics on arbitrary surfaces is of significance in graphics, digital entertainment, and engineering applications. This paper aims to improve the efficiency and enhance interactivity of the simulation without sacrificing its accuracy. We develop a GPU-based fluid solver that is applicable for curved geometry. We resort to the conformal (i.e., angle-preserving) structure to parameterize a surface in order to simplify differential operators used in Navier-Stokes and other partial differential equations. Our conformal flow method integrates fluid dynamics with Riemannian metric over curved geometry. Another significant benefit is that a conformal parameterization naturally facilitates the automatic conversion of mesh geometry into a collection of regular geometry images well suited for modern graphics hardware pipeline. Our algorithm for mapping general genus zero meshes to conformal cubic maps is rigorous, efficient, and completely automatic. The proposed framework is very general and can be used to solve other types of PDEs on surfaces while taking advantage of GPU acceleration.},

	abstract = {In isogeometric analysis (IGA for short) framework, computational domain is exactly described using the same representation as that employed in the CAD process. For a CAD object, we can construct various computational domain with same shape but with different parameterization. One basic requirement is that the resulting parameterization should have no self-intersections. In this paper, a linear and easy-to-check sufficient condition for injectivity of planar B-spline parameterization is proposed. By an example of 2D thermal conduction problem, we show that different parameterization of computational domain has different impact on the simulation result and efficiency in IGA. For problems with exact solutions, we propose a shape optimization method to obtain optimal parameterization of computational domain. The proposed injective condition is used to check the injectivity of initial parameterization constructed by discrete Coons method. Several examples and comparisons are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the initial parameterization during refinement, the optimal parameterization can achieve the same accuracy but with less degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {We outline the construction of compatible B-splines on 3D surfaces that satisfy the continuity requirements for electromagnetic scattering analysis with the boundary element method (method of moments). Our approach makes use of Non-Uniform Rational B-splines to represent model geometry and compatible B-splines to approximate the surface current, and adopts the isogeometric concept in which the basis for analysis is taken directly from CAD (geometry) data. The approach allows for high-order approximations and crucially provides a direct link with CAD data structures that allows for efficient design workflows. After outlining the construction of div- and curl-conforming B-splines defined over 3D surfaces we describe their use with the electric and magnetic field integral equations using a Galerkin formulation. We use B{\textbackslash}'ezier extraction to accelerate the computation of NURBS and B-spline terms and employ H-matrices to provide accelerated computations and memory reduction for the dense matrices that result from the boundary integral discretization. The method is verified using the well known Mie scattering problem posed over a perfectly electrically conducting sphere and the classic NASA almond problem. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the approach to handle models with complex geometry directly from CAD without mesh generation.},

	abstract = {Subdivision surfaces are proven to be a powerful tool in geometric modeling and computer graphics, due to the great flexibility they offer in capturing irregular topologies. This paper discusses the robust and efficient implementation of an isogeometric discretization approach to partial differential equations on surfaces using subdivision methodology. Elliptic equations with the Laplace-Beltrami and the surface bi-Laplacian operator as well as the associated eigenvalue problems are considered. Thereby, efficiency relies on the proper choice of a numerical quadrature scheme which preserves the expected higher order consistency. A particular emphasis is on the robustness of the approach in the vicinity of extraordinary vertices. In this paper, the focus is on Loop's subdivision scheme on triangular meshes. Based on a series of numerical experiments, different quadrature schemes are compared and a mid-edge quadrature, which is easy-to-implement via lookup tables, turns out to be a preferable choice due to its robustness and efficiency.},
